 # 🚗 Car Price Prediction App

This project predicts the resale price of a used car using machine learning (Random Forest Regressor). The model was trained on various features such as current price, fuel type, age, kilometers driven, etc.

## 📊 Features Used
- Present Price
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- Selling Type (Dealer/Individual)
- Transmission (Manual/Automatic)
- Number of Owners
- Age of the Car

## 🧠 Model Used
- Random Forest Regressor (trained using Scikit-learn)
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables


## 📈 Model Performance
R² Score: ~0.96 (Random Forest)

MAE/MSE: Acceptable levels (based on test data)

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
Deploy with Docker or on cloud (Heroku, Streamlit Cloud, etc.)

Include more data for better generalization

Use SHAP or LIME for better interpretability
